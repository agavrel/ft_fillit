### Fillit

In this program we have to fit all tetris items (tetriminos) in the smallest square possible.

The tetriminos are provided as argument (argv[1])

We can decompose the problem in the following topics:

* 1) Parsing of the tetriminos and reject invalid ones
* 2) Bruteforce (try all the possible combinations) to find the smallest square
